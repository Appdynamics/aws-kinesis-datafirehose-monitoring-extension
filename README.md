# AWS Kinesis Data Firehose Monitoring Extension

## Use Case
Captures statistics for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose from Amazon CloudWatch and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

## Prerequisites
1. Please give the following permissions to the account being used to with the extension.
    ```
    cloudwatch:ListMetrics
    cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics
    ```
2. In order to use this extension, you do need a [Standalone JAVA Machine Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Standalone+Machine+Agents) or [SIM Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Server+Visibility).  For more details on downloading these products, please  visit [here](https://download.appdynamics.com/).
3. The extension needs to be able to connect to AWS Cloudwatch in order to collect and send metrics. To do this, you will have to either establish a remote connection in between the extension and the product using access key and secret key, or have an agent running on EC2 instance, which you can use with instance profile.
<p><strong>Agent Compatibility:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: This extension is compatible with Machine Agent version 4.5.13 or later.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are seeing warning messages while starting the Machine Agent, update the http-client and http-core JARs in <code>{MACHINE_AGENT_HOME}/monitorsLibs</code> to <code>httpclient-4.5.9</code> and <code>httpcore-4.4.12</code> to make this warning go away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make this extension work on Machine Agent &lt; 4.5.13, the http-client and http-core JARs in <code>{MACHINE_AGENT_HOME}/monitorsLibs</code> need to be updated to <code>httpclient-4.5.9</code> and <code>httpcore-4.4.12</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

## Installation
1. Run `mvn clean install` from `aws-kinesis-datafirehose-monitoring-extension`
2. Copy and unzip `AWSKinesisDataFirehoseMonitor-<version>.zip` from `target` directory into `<machine_agent_dir>/monitors/`
3. Edit `config.yml` file in `AWSKinesisDataFirehoseMonitor` and provide the required configuration (see Configuration section).
4. Restart the Machine Agent.
Please place the extension in the "**monitors**" directory of your Machine Agent installation directory. Do not place the extension in the "**extensions**" directory of your Machine Agent installation directory.

## Configuration
In order to use the extension, you need to update the config.yml file that is present in the extension folder. The following is a step-by-step explanation of the configurable fields that are present in the `config.yml` file.

1. If SIM is enabled, then use the following metricPrefix - 

   `metricPrefix: "Custom Metrics|AWS Kinesis Data Firehose|"`
    
   Else, configure the "**COMPONENT_ID**" under which the metrics need to be reported. This can be done by changing the value of `<COMPONENT_ID>` in
   `metricPrefix: "Server|Component:<COMPONENT_ID>|Custom Metrics|AWS Kinesis Data Firehose|"`.

   For example,
         
    ```
    metricPrefix: "Server|Component:100|Custom Metrics|AWS Kinesis Data Firehose|"
    ```

2. Provide **accessKey**(required) and **secretKey**(required) of your account(s), also provide **displayAccountName**(any name that represents your account) and
         **regions**(required). If you are running this extension inside an EC2 instance which has **IAM profile** configured then you don't have to configure **accessKey** and  **secretKey** values, extension will use **IAM profile** to authenticate. You can provide multiple accounts and regions as below - 
   ~~~
   accounts:
     - awsAccessKey: "XXXXXXXX1"
       awsSecretKey: "XXXXXXXXXX1"
       displayAccountName: "TestAccount_1"
       regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1","us-west-2"]

     - awsAccessKey: "XXXXXXXX2"
       awsSecretKey: "XXXXXXXXXX2"
       displayAccountName: "TestAccount_2"
       regions: ["eu-central-1","eu-west-1"]
   ~~~
3. If you want to encrypt the **awsAccessKey** and **awsSecretKey** then follow the "Credentials Encryption" section and provide the encrypted values in **awsAccessKey** and **awsSecretKey**. Configure `enableDecryption` of `credentialsDecryptionConfig` to `true` and provide the encryption key in `encryptionKey`.
   For example,
   ```
   #Encryption key for Encrypted password.
   credentialsDecryptionConfig:
       enableDecryption: "true"
       encryptionKey: "XXXXXXXX"
   ```
4. To report metrics only from specific dimension values, configure the `dimesion` section. Dimension for Kinesis Data Firehose is `DeliveryStreamName`. For example to report metrics only from `DeliveryStreamName` dimension with value `Sample`, configure `dimensions` as below -

    ```
    dimensions:
      - name: "DeliveryStreamName"
        displayName: "DeliveryStreamName"
        values: ["Sample]
    ```
     If `.*` is used, all dimension values are monitored and if empty, none are monitored.
5. Configure the metrics section.
   
    For configuring the metrics, the following properties can be used:

    |     Property      |   Default value |         Possible values         |                                              Description                                                                                                |
    | :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | alias             | metric name     | Any string                      | The substitute name to be used in the metric browser instead of metric name.                                   |
    | statType          | "ave"           | "AVERAGE", "SUM", "MIN", "MAX"  | AWS configured values as returned by API                                                                       |
    | aggregationType   | "AVERAGE"       | "AVERAGE", "SUM", "OBSERVATION" | [Aggregation qualifier](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Build+a+Monitoring+Extension+Using+Java)    |
    | timeRollUpType    | "AVERAGE"       | "AVERAGE", "SUM", "CURRENT"     | [Time roll-up qualifier](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Build+a+Monitoring+Extension+Using+Java)   |
    | clusterRollUpType | "INDIVIDUAL"    | "INDIVIDUAL", "COLLECTIVE"      | [Cluster roll-up qualifier](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Build+a+Monitoring+Extension+Using+Java)|
    | multiplier        | 1               | Any number                      | Value with which the metric needs to be multiplied.                                                            |
    | convert           | null            | Any key value map               | Set of key value pairs that indicates the value to which the metrics need to be transformed. eg: UP:0, DOWN:1  |
    | delta             | false           | true, false                     | If enabled, gives the delta values of metrics instead of actual values.                                        |

   For example,
   ```
   - name: "BackupToS3.Bytes"
     alias: "S3 Backup Bytes (Unit - byte; StatType - sum)"
     statType: "sum"
     aggregationType: "AVERAGE"
     timeRollUpType: "AVERAGE"
     clusterRollUpType: "INDIVIDUAL"
     delta: false
     multiplier: 1
   ```
   
   **All these metric properties are optional, and the default value shown in the table is applied to the metric(if a property has not been specified) by default.**

### Config.yml
Please avoid using tab (\t) when editing yaml files. Please copy all the contents of the config.yml file and go to [Yaml Validator](http://www.yamllint.com/) . On reaching the website, paste the contents and press the “Go” button on the bottom left.                                                       
If you get a valid output, that means your formatting is correct and you may move on to the next step.

## Metrics
Typical metric path: `Application Infrastructure Performance|<Tier>|Custom Metrics|AWS Kinesis Data Firehose|<Account Name>|<Region>|DeliveryStreamName|<stream_name>|` followed by the metrics defined in the link below:
